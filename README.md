# User space I/O for Linux

These are demonstrations of various techniques for performing I/O from user space,
thus avoiding the need to write Linux kernel device drivers.

This is intended to accompany my presentation from Embedded World 2016, [How to avoid writing device drivers for embedded Linux](http://www.slideshare.net/chrissimmonds/userspace-drivers2016)
